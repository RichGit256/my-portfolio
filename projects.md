Project 1:

Name:  Exploratory Analysis of DeFi Trading Activity

Description: The objective of this project is to conduct an in-depth exploratory analysis of Wintermute’s on-chain trading activity to better understand its behavior and role within the DeFi ecosystem. By classifying transaction counterparties, isolating DeFi-specific interactions, and analyzing token usage, platform preferences, blockchain distribution, and temporal trends, the project aims to uncover actionable insights into Wintermute’s DeFi trading patterns. The findings are presented through clear visualizations, summary statistics, and well-documented methodologies to provide a structured, data-driven perspective on Wintermute’s decentralized market activity.

Project 2:

Name: Dynamic Web Development Team Project

Description: The objective of this group project is to design, build, and deploy a fully functional full-stack web application that brings your original concept pitch to life through real user interaction. The project focuses on implementing a Node.js and Express backend to handle server logic, routing, and data flow, alongside a dynamic front end rendered with EJS templating. A MongoDB database is used to support user authentication and profile management, as well as any additional data storage required by the application. The final outcome demonstrates your ability to integrate frontend and backend systems, manage data dynamically, follow good coding practices, and successfully deploy and run the application on the assigned CODIO server environment.

Project 3: Funmyy's Kitchen

Description: One of my first projects. The objective of this project was to design and develop a professional, responsive website for Funmyy’s Kitchen that effectively translates the restaurant’s brand into a functional digital experience. From a developer’s perspective, the focus was on building a clean, intuitive interface that presents menu information clearly, supports user interaction, and performs reliably across devices and browsers. The project aimed to demonstrate strong front-end and web development practices, including structured layouts, accessibility considerations, performance optimization, and deployment of a live production site, while delivering a solution that meets the client’s business needs and enhances their online presence.
